There are many Python GUI toolkit which let you create nice GUI applications. But I would like to use PySimpleGUI as a beginning toolkit of Python GUI programming.

The reason is in its name - **simple**. 

Wait a minute... What is GUI?

A GUI application simplifies how users use their computer. Unlike CLI programmes, users won't need a good memory to remember a bunch of commands. With a few clicks, users can copy files to another directory, chat with others easily, and see nice web content.
