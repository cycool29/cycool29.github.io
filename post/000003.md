While ago, I got my first Raspberry Pi. Like most of the Linux users (specifically, Raspberry Pi users) transferring from Windows, I am getting crazy with these questions:

> How to install emoji font on my pi?

> Why Discord is not supporting ARM architecture?

> The built-in screenshot tool really sucks... 

> Where can I install ZOOM?????

I found a bunch of tutorials online, but most of them are **outdated**, and even **broke my system**.

And... I found Pi-Apps! ðŸ¤©

[![Botspot/pi-apps - GitHub](https://gh-card.dev/repos/Botspot/pi-apps.svg)](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps)

Now I am able to install emoji fonts, a usable Discord client, a powerful screenshot tool, and even ZOOM Meeting client!

<h2><span id="what-is-pi-apps">What is Pi-Apps?</span></h2>

Pi-Apps is a well-maintained collection of app installation-scripts that you can run with one click. 

In short, it is an **app store**.

![Main window](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9pabl9zu2vxpnetg85ow.png)
 

Unlike the tutorials or blog posts on the web, Pi-Apps has a beautiful GUI, constantly maintained scripts, bug reporting system, and [a cheerful community](https://discord.gg/RXSTvaUvuu)! 

Pi-Apps now serves over **1,000,000** people and hosts [nearly 200 apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/wiki/Apps-List).

<h2><span id="how-to-install">Looks cool... How can I install it on my Pi??</span></h2>

Here is the one-liner command ðŸ˜Ž :

```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash
```

### Supported systems:

- [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) (32-bit/64-bit) (Buster/Bullseye)
   - Fully supported.    

- [Twister OS](https://twisteros.com/download.html)
   - Fully supported, preinstalled.    

- Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, any other Debian-based ARM OS
   - Pi-Apps should mostly work but you may encounter errors for some apps.    

- Android, ChromeOS, non-ARM, non-Debian operating systems
   - Not supported. Your mileage may vary.    

**To install Pi-Apps manually** if you prefer to see what happens under the hood
 
```
git clone https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps ~/pi-apps
~/pi-apps/install
```
**To uninstall Pi-Apps**
This will not uninstall any apps that you installed through Pi-Apps.

```
~/pi-apps/uninstall
```
<h2><span id="how-to-launch">Now I have it installed... How to launch it?</span></h2>
